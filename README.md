### Dummy HeyJob applications training and testing modules using linear regression.

To train the model and save it, add the paths to the setting file and run `python job_app/train.py`
To test the model on new data, add the paths to the setting file and run `python job_app/test.py`



TODO: Use multiple models, evaluate and select the best model
TODO: Fine tune the selected model
TODO: Add unit tests
TODO: Add Doc strings
TODO: Enhance the program
TODO: To extend this to run every day, We can add a cronjob or celery to run tasks to collects up-to-date data and train
TODO: Consider using spark streaming linear regression to updating the parameters of the model as new data arrives.
